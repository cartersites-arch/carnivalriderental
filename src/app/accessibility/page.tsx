      <p className="mt-2 text-ink-soft">We want everyone to be able to find a ride and reach an operator here, whatever device or assistive technology they use. We aim to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at level AA.</p>

      <ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 text-ink-soft">
        <li>Pages use headings, landmarks and labelled form fields, work with a keyboard, and keep text readable against its background. We check these with automated tools and keyboard testing; a full audit by an accessibility specialist has not been done yet.</li>
        <li>Ride photos come from operators and some carry only the ride name as their description.</li>
        <li>The chat assistant writes its replies with AI. The same help is available through the event form on the <Link className="underline" href={paths.concierge()}>concierge page</Link> and by email.</li>
        <li>Videos carry captions and a text transcript.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="mt-8 text-2xl">Tell us what isn&rsquo;t working</h2>
      <p className="mt-2 text-ink-soft">If any part of this site is hard to use, email <a className="underline" href={`mailto:support@${BRAND.domain}`}>support@{BRAND.domain}</a> with the page address and what happened. We will reply, and where we can we will fix it.</p>
